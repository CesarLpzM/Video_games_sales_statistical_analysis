# Video games sales statistical analysis

## 📉 Problem solving
I identified patterns in reviews, genres, platforms, and historical sales to predict the success of online video games. This will support the planning of effective advertising campaigns.

## 🎯 Objective
To find key insights which will help the marketing department of the online video games store for planning effective advertising campaigns.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- *Languages:* python 
- *Data Science:* pandas, numpy, math, scipy
- *Visualization:* seaborn, matplotlib

## 🗝️ Key steps
1.- *Exploratory data analysis:* identify patterns, outliers, missing values, and initial correlations.  
2.- *Data preprocessing:* data cleansing, rename columns, data imputation.  
3.- *Statistical anaysis:* draw conclusions and create user profiles for a better understanding of their behaviors.  
4.- *A/B test:* statistically validate my hypotheses.  
5.- *Conclusions:* document conclusions with recommendations for the online video games store.  

## ✅ Results
After completing the project, the following insights were founded:  
1.- Top 5 video games platforms of the users are: PS2, X360, PS3, Wii and DS. Although there are slight differences in the order depending on the region.  
2.- All platforms experience a boom period of approximately 10 years, during which they reach their highest sales.  
3.- Critic ratings influence sales more than user ratings.  
4.- Top 5 video games genres of the users are: "Shooter," "Action," "Sports," "Misc," and "Role-playing". Although there are slight differences in the order depending on the platform and region.  
5.- In all regions, we see the same pattern of preferences by "ESRB" rating: 1st "E", 2nd "T", and 3th "M".  
6.- User ratings on the "XOne" and "PC" platforms are different, as are the "Sports" and "Action" genres.
